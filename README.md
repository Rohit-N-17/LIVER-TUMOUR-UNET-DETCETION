# LIVER-TUMOUR-UNET-DETCETION
The Liver Tumor Detection using U-Net project focuses on building a deep learning model for automatic segmentation and detection of liver tumors from medical imaging data such as CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. Detecting and segmenting liver tumors is a critical step in early diagnosis, for liver cancer patients.
